#Things I learnt 
I learnt many things by doing this project about Archival Devices (Printers & Tape Storage) as well as other computer hardware systems. The first being how printers were originally created. When printing was invented, it was noted that there was a general desire in people forlearning throughout Europe and this invention made books cheaper and improved the ability in people tohttps://github.com/exploreread more books. In order to grasp more knowledge, people started to learn to read and in order to communicate with others who were not within the talking distance, they started to learn writing. This created the revolutions of printers. Printers are very important in our society because they help create physical copies of data we put in our computers. I learnt this by doing in-depth researcg on Binary Systms as well as other number systems in printers and tape storage. Although, it was kind of difficult to find a direct link of printers to number systems, I was able to find out more about how binary coding is used for colour (RGB) in digital imaging.  This is the basis for the inks used to print color in magazines. Because the inks can't do a perfect job of making colors,  printers also use black ink (referred to as K) and the printer's color space is called CMYK
